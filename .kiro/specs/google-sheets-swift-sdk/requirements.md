# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive Swift SDK for the Google Sheets API that enables iOS and macOS developers to easily integrate Google Sheets functionality into their applications. The SDK will provide a clean, Swift-native interface for common spreadsheet operations including reading, writing, updating, and managing spreadsheet data and metadata.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an iOS/macOS developer, I want to authenticate with Google Sheets API using OAuth2, so that I can securely access and manipulate spreadsheet data on behalf of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer initializes the SDK THEN the system SHALL provide OAuth2 authentication flow integration
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store and manage access tokens securely
3. WHEN access tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them using refresh tokens
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 1.1

**User Story:** As an iOS/macOS developer, I want to authenticate with Google Sheets API using service account credentials, so that I can access spreadsheets programmatically without user interaction for server-to-server scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer initializes the SDK with service account credentials THEN the system SHALL support JSON key file authentication
2. WHEN using service account authentication THEN the system SHALL generate JWT tokens for API access
3. WHEN service account tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically generate new JWT tokens
4. WHEN service account authentication is used THEN the system SHALL support impersonation of domain users when configured
5. IF service account credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and retrieve spreadsheet metadata, so that I can manage spreadsheet properties and structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer requests to create a new spreadsheet THEN the system SHALL call the sheets.spreadsheets.create endpoint and return a Spreadsheet object
2. WHEN a developer requests spreadsheet information by ID THEN the system SHALL call the sheets.spreadsheets.get endpoint with proper parameters
3. WHEN retrieving spreadsheet data THEN the system SHALL support optional parameters like ranges, includeGridData, and field masks
4. IF a spreadsheet ID is invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to read cell values from spreadsheets, so that I can retrieve and process data from Google Sheets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer requests values from a specific range THEN the system SHALL call the sheets.spreadsheets.values.get endpoint
2. WHEN reading values THEN the system SHALL support A1 notation for range specification
3. WHEN reading values THEN the system SHALL support different value render options (FORMATTED_VALUE, UNFORMATTED_VALUE, FORMULA)
4. WHEN reading values THEN the system SHALL support different major dimensions (ROWS, COLUMNS)
5. WHEN reading multiple ranges THEN the system SHALL support batch operations via sheets.spreadsheets.values.batchGet

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write and update cell values in spreadsheets, so that I can modify spreadsheet data programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer wants to update cell values THEN the system SHALL call the sheets.spreadsheets.values.update endpoint
2. WHEN updating values THEN the system SHALL support different value input options (RAW, USER_ENTERED)
3. WHEN appending data THEN the system SHALL call the sheets.spreadsheets.values.append endpoint
4. WHEN clearing values THEN the system SHALL call the sheets.spreadsheets.values.clear endpoint
5. WHEN performing batch updates THEN the system SHALL support the sheets.spreadsheets.batchUpdate endpoint

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Swift-native data types and async/await patterns, so that the SDK feels natural and modern in Swift applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use async/await for asynchronous operations
2. WHEN handling responses THEN the system SHALL provide strongly-typed Swift models for all API responses
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use Swift's error handling mechanisms with custom error types
4. WHEN working with data THEN the system SHALL provide convenient Swift extensions and utilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues and handle failures gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information including HTTP status codes and error messages
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL handle 429 responses appropriately
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide optional logging capabilities for API requests and responses

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SDK to be easily installable via Swift Package Manager, so that I can integrate it into my projects with minimal setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer adds the SDK to their project THEN the system SHALL be available as a Swift Package
2. WHEN installing the SDK THEN the system SHALL have minimal external dependencies
3. WHEN using the SDK THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation and usage examples
4. WHEN building projects THEN the system SHALL support iOS 13+, macOS 10.15+, and other Apple platforms
